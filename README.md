# Tracks-Roller-Skating-Invitation
I built and deployed this website as an invitation for the February themed rollar skating party at Tracks, Denver.  My main goal was to duplicate Tracks' website WITHOUT cutting and pasting every element but building from scratch.  I used it as a continuing education project when I was employed at Techtonic.
